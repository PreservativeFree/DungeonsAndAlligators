Dungeons And Alligators

Please run DungeonsAndAlligatorsMain.java to start this game

Dungeons and Alligators is a text based game that places you on a 8x8 board or Dungeon. You, the dashing adventurer, are looking for 
Gold bars and Silver coins while trying to avoid the angry Alligator looking for a snack, so avoid him at all costs! 
You travel by typing in N, E, W, or S. Lowercase is OK too.
The goal aka secret exit is hidden from you, and the game begins with
the player starting at point (0, 0) in the board. You get 3 lives, these deplete every time you

1. Attempt to move outside the Dungeon by moving anywhere outside the board
2. Land in one of the 2 traps in the game
3. Have run into the jaws of the hungry Alligator

One of the three treasures is a map that tells you where the secret exit is, yet it is not necessary
to collect it. It is possible to run into the secret exit without knowing it, but it definitely helps having a guide
telling you where the exact exit is, if you can find it, as the game does not provide you the location of the map.
I have a more graphics centered version of this game. It is written in C#. Please email me at thegreyabove@gmail.com if you would like
to try out this version of the program.
